# next-node recommender
A knowledge-based recommender tool that predicts next node in business process modeling. The tool offers a method for design-time autocompletion of process models. It leverages the pre-trained Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) deep learning model to transform n-grams extracted from process models into numerical vectors, enabling semantic similarity comparisons.
